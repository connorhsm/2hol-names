## 2HOL Names

[2HOL is a survival game](https://twohoursonelife.com/) where players are born
as kids to other players and the mother is able to choose the first name of the
child from a predetermined list of names. If a player is instead the first
person of a lineage, i.e. an Eve, they choose their last name and become "Eve
[Last Name]".

This simple web app allows you to see what name you will get based on the name
you attempt to choose. Try it out [here](https://nmay231.github.io/2hol-names/).
